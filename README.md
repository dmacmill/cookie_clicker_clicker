# Cookie Clicker Clicker

A bot for the classic game "Cookie Clicker".

Respect to Orteil for making the game, love it. This is just a fun project to get into 
Selenium, nothing more. I am not affiliated with the maker of this game.

Highest cookie amount I baked was some amount over 
1 billion, which is lame by cookie clicker standards :P

# Install
ensure python3-venv is installed, then:

`python3 -m venv .venv/`

`source .venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 clicker.py`

# Still todo:
 - Convert cost of buildings to sci notation for optimal playstyle.
 - fix chrome crashing after ~1 billion cookies
 - find suitable selenium + chrome docker container
